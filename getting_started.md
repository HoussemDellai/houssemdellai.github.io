# Azure Blob Fuse with Managed Identity in AKS

## Introduction

In this lab, we will attach an Azure Blob Fuse to an AKS pod.
This could be done either dynamically or statically.
Dynamically means that AKS will create and manage automatically the storage account and blobs.
Static creation means we can bring our own storage account and blobs.
But with this option we need to configure the authentication and authorization.
